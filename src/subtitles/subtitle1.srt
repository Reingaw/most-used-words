1
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,050
The world is changed.

2
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,350
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,450
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,450
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,750
Much that once was...

6
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,550
...is lost.

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,250
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:04,750
The Lord of the Rings.

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,450
It began with the forging of the great rings.

10
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,650
Three were given to the elves:

11
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,550
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

12
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,350
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

13
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,850
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

14
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,650
And nine...

15
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,750
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

16
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,850
...who, above all else, desire power.

17
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,050
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

18
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,850
But they were all of them deceived.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,260
For another ring was made.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,560
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,460
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

22
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,760
...to control all others.

23
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,860
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,260
...and his will to dominate all life.

25
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,160
One ring to rule them all.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,760
One by one...

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,460
...the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,760
But there were some who resisted.

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,860
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,760
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,870
Hold positions!

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Fire the arrows!

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,770
Victory was near.

34
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,870
But the power of the ring...

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,970
...could not be undone.

36
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,070
It was in this moment...

37
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,670
...when all hope had faded...

38
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,870
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

39
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,380
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

40
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,680
The ring passed to Isildur...

41
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,980
...who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
But the hearts of men...

43
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,580
...are easily corrupted.

44
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,380
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

45
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,290
It betrayed Isildur...

46
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,590
...to his death.

47
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,590
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

48
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,090
...were lost.

49
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,190
History became legend...

50
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,390
...legend became myth.

51
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,390
And for two and a half thousand years...

52
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,390
...the ring passed out of all knowledge.

53
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,790
Until, when chance came...

54
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,590
...it ensnared a new bearer.

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,690
My precious.

56
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,590
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

57
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,590
...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

58
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,890
And there it consumed him.

59
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,090
It came to me.

60
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,690
My own. My love. My own.

61
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,590
My precious.

62
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,690
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

63
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,700
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

64
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,390
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,100
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

67
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,100
...whispers of a nameless fear.

68
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,600
And the ring of power perceived...

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
...its time had now come.

70
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,700
It abandoned Gollum.

71
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,700
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,200
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

73
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
What's this?

74
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
A hobbit.

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,100
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

76
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,200
A ring.

77
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,200
Lost!

78
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,800
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,300
My precious is lost!

80
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,900
For the time will soon come...

81
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,200
...when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

82
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,500
...in the year 1400...

83
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
...by Shire-reckoning.

84
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,910
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

85
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,210
...the Shire...

86
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,210
...Middle-earth.

87
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,110
The third age of this world.

88
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,510
The Fellowship of the Ring.

89
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,410
There and back again.

90
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,110
A Hobbit's tale.

91
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,210
By Bilbo Baggins.

92
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,710
Now...

93
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,510
...where to begin?

94
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,910
Ah, yes...

95
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,210
"Concerning...

96
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,910
...Hobbits."

97
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,510
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

98
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,810
...for many hundreds of years...

99
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,120
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

100
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,220
...by the world of the big folk.

101
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,120
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,620
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,720
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

104
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,120
...nor counted among the very wise.

105
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,520
Frodo! Someone at the door.

106
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,320
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

107
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,820
...that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

108
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,520
A rather unfair observation...

109
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,220
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

110
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,520
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,820
But where our hearts truly lie...

112
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
...is in peace and quiet...

113
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
...and good, tilled earth.

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,320
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

115
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,820
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

116
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,220
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

117
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,720
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

118
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,230
Frodo, the door!

119
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,030
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

120
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,930
Frodo!

121
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,130
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

122
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,730
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

123
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,930
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

124
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,430
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

125
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,630
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

126
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,130
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

127
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,230
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

128
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,640
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

129
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,040
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

130
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

131
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,540
How is the old rascal?

132
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,640
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

133
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,240
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

134
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,440
Well, that should please him.

135
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,440
Half the Shire's been invited.

136
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,340
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

137
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,740
And so life in the Shire goes on...

138
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,040
...very much as it has this past age.

139
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,640
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

140
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,840
If it comes at all.

141
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,540
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

142
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,140
...passing from one generation to the next.

143
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,540
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

144
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,240
...in Bag End.

145
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,750
And there always will be.

146
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,750
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

147
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,350
I mean, more than usual.

148
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,250
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

149
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,950
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

150
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,450
Where's it gone?

151
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,250
He's up to something.

152
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,850
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

153
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,920
But I know you have something to do with it.

154
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
Good gracious me.

155
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,260
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

156
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Indeed.

157
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,960
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

158
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,260
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

159
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,160
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

160
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

161
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,860
Oh, really?

162
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,460
Gandalf! Gandalf!

163
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,860
Fireworks, Gandalf!

164
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,460
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

165
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Gandalf?

166
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,960
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

167
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,360
So am I.

168
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,670
No, thank you!

169
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,570
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

170
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,370
And what about very old friends?

171
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,370
Gandalf?

172
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,370
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

173
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,670
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

174
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,570
You haven't aged a day.

175
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,170
Come on, come in!

176
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,770
Welcome, welcome.

177
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh, here we are.

178
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,680
Tea... or maybe something a little stronger?

179
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,580
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

180
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

181
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,380
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

182
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,280
Just tea, thank you.

183
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
I was expecting you sometime last week.

184
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,880
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

185
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,180
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

186
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,780
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

187
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,980
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart...

188
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,680
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

189
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,680
I've just found some sponge cake.

190
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,420
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

191
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,490
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

192
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,790
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

193
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

194
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,680
I'm not at home!

195
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,290
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

196
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,630
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

197
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,690
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

198
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,866
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

199
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,790
...never giving me a moment's peace.

200
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,090
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

201
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,790
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

202
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,890
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

203
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,390
All the arrangements are made.

204
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,990
Oh, thank you.

205
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,790
Frodo suspects something.

206
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,490
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

207
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,290
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

208
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,690
You will tell him, won't you?

209
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,590
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

210
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,390
I know.

211
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,090
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

212
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,000
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

213
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,000
The woods, the fields.

214
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,500
Little rivers.

215
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,700
I am old, Gandalf.

216
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

217
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
I feel thin.

218
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,000
Sort of stretched...

219
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,500
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

220
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,200
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

221
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,600
And I don't expect I shall return.

222
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,100
In fact, I mean not to.

223
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,700
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

224
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Gandalf, my old friend...

225
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,700
...this will be a night to remember.

226
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,710
Hello, hello.

227
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,910
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

228
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,510
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

229
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,610
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

230
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,610
Go on!

231
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,510
So there I was...

232
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,810
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

233
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,010
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

234
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,510
...about how they were going to cook us.

235
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,710
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

236
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,310
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

237
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,110
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

238
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,620
...and turned them all to stone!

239
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,420
Quickly.

240
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
Up they go!

241
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,820
No no, the big one - big one

242
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,720
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

243
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,820
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,920
Good gracious, you have been productive.

245
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,320
Bilbo?

246
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,720
Sackville-Bagginses!

247
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Quickly, hide!

248
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,120
Thank you, my boy.

249
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,920
You're a good lad, Frodo.

250
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm very selfish, you know.

251
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,920
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,806
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

253
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,230
...but it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,220
I think it was because...

255
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,620
...of all my numerous relations...

256
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,420
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,810
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,530
No.

259
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,330
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,830
The point is, Frodo...

261
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,930
...you'll be all right.

262
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,470
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,130
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

264
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,830
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,230
Bilbo.

266
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,030
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,630
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

268
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,640
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

269
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,440
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,640
I might've known.

271
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,940
Speech!

273
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Speech!

274
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

275
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,540
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

276
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,240
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

277
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
...Hornblowers...

278
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,340
...Bolgers...

279
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,340
...Bracegirdles...

280
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,140
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

281
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,840
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,140
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

284
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,340
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,040
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

286
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,750
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,150
I have things to do.

288
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,650
I've put this off for far too long.

289
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,450
I regret to announce this is the end!

290
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,850
I'm going now.

291
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,850
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

292
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,450
Goodbye.

293
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,750
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

294
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,360
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

295
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,460
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

296
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,760
...and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,950
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,860
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

299
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,760
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

300
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,660
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,060
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,560
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

303
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,060
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,160
No. Wait, it's...

305
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,360
...here in my pocket.

306
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,160
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

307
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
Yet, after all, why not?

308
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,660
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,360
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,960
Well, no.

311
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,860
And yes.

312
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,870
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel I ike parting with it.

313
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,970
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

314
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,270
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

315
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,470
It's mine.

316
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,370
My own.

317
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,570
- My precious.
- Precious?

318
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,670
It's been called that before, but not by you.

319
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,470
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,470
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

321
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,470
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,870
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,770
I am not trying to rob you.

324
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,570
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,270
All your long years, we've been friends.

326
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,870
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,570
Let it go.

328
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,080
You're right, Gandalf.

329
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,880
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,270
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,980
Yes, it is time.

332
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,580
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

333
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,480
I've thought up an ending for my book:

334
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,980
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

335
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,780
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

336
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,280
Goodbye, Gandalf.

337
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,580
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

338
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,590
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

339
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,690
Until our next meeting.

340
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,590
It's mine. My own.

341
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,290
My precious.

342
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,390
Riddles in the dark.

343
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,190
Bilbo!

344
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,790
Bilbo!

345
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,490
My precious.

346
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,190
Precious.

347
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,890
He's gone, hasn't he?

348
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,790
He talked for so long about leaving...

349
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,690
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

350
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,200
Gandalf?

351
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,050
Bilbo's ring.

352
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,750
He's gone to stay with the elves.

353
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,950
He's left you Bag End.

354
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,250
Along with all his possessions.

355
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,250
The ring is yours now.

356
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,350
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

357
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,831
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

358
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,150
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

359
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,750
I don't understand.

360
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,150
Neither do I.

361
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,750
Keep it secret.

362
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,750
Keep it safe.

363
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,850
Shire!

364
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,250
Baggins!

365
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,650
"The year 3434 of the second age.

366
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,150
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

367
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,150
...and the finding of the ring of power."

368
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,550
"It has come to me.

369
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,150
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

370
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,750
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

371
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,750
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

372
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,550
It is precious to me...

373
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,050
...though I buy it with great pain.

374
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,250
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

375
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,250
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

376
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,550
A secret now that only fire can tell."

377
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,250
Shire...

378
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,350
...Baggins.

379
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,850
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

380
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,050
That way.

381
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,950
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

382
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,350
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

383
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,850
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

384
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,950
<i>But there still be...</i>

385
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,550
<i>...many miles to go</i>

386
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,750
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

387
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,050
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

388
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,150
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

389
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,750
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

390
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,950
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

391
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,160
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

392
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,250
War is brewing.

393
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,660
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

394
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,660
Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is.

395
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,250
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

396
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,260
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

397
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,060
And proud of it.

398
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,660
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

399
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,660
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

400
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,060
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

401
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,760
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

402
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,360
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

403
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,960
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

404
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,560
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

405
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,850
Does she?

406
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,460
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

407
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,760
Is it secret? Is it safe?

408
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
What are you doing?

409
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,960
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

410
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,360
It's quite cool.

411
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,560
What can you see?

412
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,760
Can you see anything?

413
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,960
Nothing.

414
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,460
There's nothing.

415
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,160
Wait.

416
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,460
There are markings.

417
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,360
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

418
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,060
There are few who can.

419
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,360
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

420
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Mordor!

421
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,460
In the common tongue, it says:

422
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,160
"One ring to rule them all...

423
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,760
...One ring to find them...

424
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,160
...One ring to bring them all...

425
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,460
...and in the darkness bind them."

426
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,160
This is the One ring...

427
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,460
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

428
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,760
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

429
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,160
Bilbo found it.

430
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,560
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

431
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,260
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

432
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,860
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

433
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,860
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

434
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,560
The ring has awoken.

435
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,460
It's heard its master's call.

436
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,460
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

437
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
No, Frodo.

438
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,660
The spirit of Sauron endured.

439
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,060
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

440
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,660
Sauron has returned.

441
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,660
His orcs have multiplied.

442
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,860
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

443
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,760
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

444
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,170
He is seeking it.

445
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,060
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

446
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,160
For the ring yearns above all else...

447
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,760
...to return to the hand of its master.

448
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,860
They are one...

449
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

450
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Frodo...

451
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,660
...he must never find it.

452
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
All right.

453
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,570
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

454
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,470
No one knows it's here, do they?

455
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,370
Do they, Gandalf?

456
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,770
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

457
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,970
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

458
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,370
But the enemy found him first.

459
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,670
I don't know how long they tortured him.

460
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,270
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

461
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,670
Shire!

462
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,470
Baggins!

463
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,570
Shire.

464
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,470
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

465
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,470
Who goes there?

466
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,470
Take it, Gandalf!

467
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,970
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

468
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,370
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

469
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,870
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

470
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,670
I dare not take it.

471
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,470
Not even to keep it safe.

472
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,670
Understand, Frodo...

473
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,870
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

474
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:05,870
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

475
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,570
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

476
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,070
No, it can't.

477
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,870
What must I do?

478
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,870
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

479
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,470
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

480
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,870
Bree.

481
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,770
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

482
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,470
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

483
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,370
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

484
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,570
I don't have any answers.

485
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,470
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

486
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,970
He'll know what to do.

487
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,370
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

488
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,170
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

489
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,070
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

490
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,970
I can cut across country easily enough.

491
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,870
My dear Frodo.

492
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,170
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

493
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,170
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

494
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,770
And yet, after a hundred years...

495
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,970
...they can still surprise you.

496
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,070
Get down.

497
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,570
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

498
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,610
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

499
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,510
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there... If you follow me.

500
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,970
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

501
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,070
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

502
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,370
Nothing important.

503
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,370
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

504
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,146
...and something about the end of the world but...

505
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,770
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

506
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,270
No?

507
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,670
Perhaps not.

508
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,270
I've thought of a better use for you.

509
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,970
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

510
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,770
Be careful, both of you.

511
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,780
The enemy has many spies in his service:

512
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,870
Birds, beasts.

513
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,570
Is it safe?

514
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,580
Never put it on...

515
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,170
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

516
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,870
Always remember, Frodo...

517
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,470
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

518
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
It wants to be found.

519
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,780
This is it.

520
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
This is what?

521
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
If I take one more step...

522
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,980
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

523
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,880
Come on, Sam.

524
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,180
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

525
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,380
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

526
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,980
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

527
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,280
...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

528
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,080
Sam.

529
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,780
Wood-elves.

530
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,880
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

531
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,180
To the Grey Havens.

532
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,880
They're leaving Middle-earth.

533
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,180
Never to return.

534
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,180
I don't know why...

535
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,380
...it makes me sad.

536
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,880
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

537
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,580
Just shut your eyes...

538
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,380
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

539
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,580
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

540
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,580
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

541
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,580
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

542
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,280
Me neither, Sam.

543
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,880
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

544
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,780
The hour grows late.

545
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,380
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

546
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,180
...seeking my counsel.

547
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,280
For that is why you have come, is it not?

548
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,780
My old friend.

549
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,680
Saruman.

550
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,480
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

551
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,580
So the ring of power has been found.

552
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,890
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

553
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,380
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

554
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,290
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

555
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,190
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

556
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,990
Time?

557
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,590
What time do you think we have?

558
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,790
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

559
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,290
He cannot yet take physical form...

560
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,180
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

561
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,790
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

562
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:14,290
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

563
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,090
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

564
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:25,090
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

565
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,990
The eye of Sauron.

566
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,790
He is gathering all evil to him.

567
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,990
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

568
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:36,090
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

569
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,790
You know this?

570
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,890
How?

571
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,090
I have seen it.

572
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,690
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

573
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,990
Why?

574
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,090
Why should we fear to use it?

575
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,690
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

576
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,090
We do not know who else may be watching.

577
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,490
The hour is later than you think.

578
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,990
Sauron's forces are already moving.

579
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,990
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

580
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,390
The Nine?

581
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,490
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

582
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,490
...disguised as riders in black.

583
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,590
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

584
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,490
And kill the one who carries it.

585
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,390
Frodo!

586
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,390
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

587
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,990
There are none who can.

588
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,190
Against the power of Mordor...

589
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,090
...there can be no victory.

590
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,190
We must join with him, Gandalf.

591
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,790
We must join with Sauron.

592
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,090
It would be wise, my friend.

593
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,190
Tell me...

594
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,890
...friend...

595
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,790
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

596
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,090
I gave you the chance of...

597
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,890
...aiding me willingly...

598
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:13,190
...but you have elected the way of pain!

599
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,100
Mr. Frodo?

600
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,500
Frodo? Frodo!

601
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,100
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

602
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,190
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

603
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,900
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

604
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,900
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

605
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Frodo.

606
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,400
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

607
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,000
Get off him.

608
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,990
Come on, Frodo.

609
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,000
What's the meaning of this?

610
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,490
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

611
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,900
You get back here!

612
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,200
Get out of my field!

613
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,100
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

614
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,300
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

615
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,700
And some cabbages.

616
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

617
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,900
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

618
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,400
...he's clearly overreacting.

619
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,100
Run!

620
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,100
Oh, that was close.

621
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,300
I think I've broken something.

622
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,700
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

623
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,400
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

624
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,000
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

625
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,200
That's mine.

626
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,600
That's nice, Merry.

627
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Here's a nice one, Sam.

628
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,800
I think we should get off the road.

629
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,500
Get off the road!

630
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,100
Quick!

631
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,300
Be quiet!

632
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,800
What was that?

633
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,000
Anything?

634
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,200
Nothing.

635
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,200
What is going on?

636
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,410
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

637
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,310
Frodo?

638
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,110
Get down!

639
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,210
I have to leave the Shire.

640
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,610
Sam and I must get to Bree.

641
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,210
Right.

642
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,810
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

643
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,410
Run!

644
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,610
This way! Follow me!

645
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,410
Run!

646
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,310
Get the rope, Sam!

647
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,510
Frodo!

648
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,610
Run, Frodo!

649
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,110
Go!
- Hurry!

650
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,810
Frodo, come on!

651
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,910
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

652
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,910
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

653
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,210
Come on.

654
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,710
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

655
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,110
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

656
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,110
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

657
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,810
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

658
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,410
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

659
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,110
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

660
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,310
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

661
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,610
Can't be too careful.

662
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,710
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

663
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,410
Excuse me.

664
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,210
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

665
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:18,310
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

666
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:23,310
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

667
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:26,510
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

668
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,310
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

669
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:33,610
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

670
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,810
Gandalf.

671
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,310
Oh, yes...

672
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,610
...I remember. Elderly chap.

673
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,910
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

674
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,120
Not seen him for six months.

675
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,320
What do we do now?

676
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,640
Sam...

677
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,640
...he'll be here. He'll come.

678
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,530
Get out of my way!

679
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,630
What's that?

680
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,230
This, my friend, is a pint.

681
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,140
It comes in pints?

682
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,040
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

683
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,230
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

684
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,430
Excuse me.

685
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,130
That man in the corner. Who is he?

686
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,730
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

687
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,430
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

688
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:56,130
Strider.

689
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,330
<i>Baggins...</i>

690
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,430
<i>Baggins...</i>

691
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,130
<i>Baggins...</i>

692
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,830
<i>Baggins...</i>

693
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,430
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

694
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,730
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

695
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,030
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

696
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,330
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

697
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,630
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

698
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,630
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

699
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:25,630
<i>I see you.</i>

700
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,120
<i>There is no life...</i>

701
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,420
<i>...in the void.</i>

702
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,120
<i>Only...</i>

703
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,630
<i>...death.</i>

704
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:47,330
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

705
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,230
What do you want?

706
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,820
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

707
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,830
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

708
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,630
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

709
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,420
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

710
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,620
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

711
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,020
Yes.

712
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,920
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

713
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,420
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

714
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,220
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

715
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,420
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

716
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,720
They're coming.

717
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,820
What are they?

718
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,120
They were once men.

719
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,510
Great kings of men.

720
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,110
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

721
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,910
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

722
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,410
One by one, falling into darkness.

723
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,110
Now they are slaves to his will.

724
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,210
They are the Nazgûl.

725
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:24,010
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

726
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,410
At all times they feel...

727
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,410
...the presence of the ring...

728
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:33,010
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

729
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,010
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

730
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:58,210
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

731
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,410
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

732
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:05,610
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

733
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,110
We have no choice but to trust him.

734
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,610
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

735
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:18,310
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

736
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:21,710
We're going to see the elves.

737
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:47,510
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

738
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,510
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

739
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,910
What about second breakfast?

740
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:59,310
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

741
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:04,810
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

742
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,210
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

743
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,410
Pippin!

744
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,200
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

745
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,000
<i>Tinúviel the elven-fair</i>

746
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:03,200
<i>Immortal maiden elven-wise</i>

747
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:10,500
<i>About him cast her night-dark hair</i>

748
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
<i>And arms like silver glimmering."</i>

749
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,400
Who is she?

750
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,600
This woman you sing of.

751
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,500
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

752
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:31,700
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

753
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,800
What happened to her?

754
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,500
She died.

755
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,800
Get some sleep, Frodo.

756
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,200
The power of Isengard is at your command...

757
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,700
...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

758
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:14,900
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

759
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,900
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

760
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,400
We have work to do.

761
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,700
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

762
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,100
Rip them all down.

763
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:47,290
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

764
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,590
We shall rest here tonight.

765
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,690
These are for you.
Keep them close.

766
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,490
I'm going to have a look around.

767
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,790
Stay here.

768
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,590
My tomato's burst.

769
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,690
Could I have some bacon?

770
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,790
Want a tomato, Sam?

771
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,790
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

772
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,690
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

773
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:33,790
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

774
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,090
Go!

775
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,080
Back, you devils!

776
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,780
Frodo!

777
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,680
Oh, Sam.

778
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:47,770
Strider!

779
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,780
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

780
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,180
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

781
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:07,970
Hurry!

782
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:12,080
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

783
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,170
Hold on, Frodo.

784
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,780
Gandalf!

785
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:21,970
Gwaihir - Go.

786
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,860
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

787
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,860
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

788
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,560
Is he going to die?

789
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:12,560
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

790
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:21,560
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

791
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,360
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

792
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,680
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

793
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,860
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

794
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,360
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

795
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,760
Frodo.

796
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:18,460
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

797
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,860
Hear my voice... come back to the light.

798
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,060
Who is she?

799
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,460
Frodo.

800
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,160
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

801
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,760
He's not going to last.

802
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,560
We must get him to my father.

803
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,160
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

804
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:54,360
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

805
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,260
Stay with the Hobbits, I'll send horses for you.

806
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,860
I'm the faster rider, I'll take him.

807
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,360
The Road is too dangerous.

808
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:03,550
What are they saying?

809
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,770
Frodo is dying. If I can get across the river...

810
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:09,250
...the power of my people will protect him.

811
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,260
I do not fear them.

812
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:16,450
As you wish.

813
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,660
Arwen...

814
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:25,850
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

815
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:35,250
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

816
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,750
Ride fast Asfaloth!

817
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,340
Give up the halfling, She-elf.

818
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,150
If you want him, come and claim him.

819
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,440
Waters of the Misty Mountains...

820
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,850
...listen to the great word.

821
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,840
Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths

822
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,440
Waters of the Misty Mountains...

823
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,939
...listen to the great word.

824
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,840
Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths

825
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,540
No. No!

826
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,040
Frodo, no.

827
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,540
Frodo, don't give in.

828
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,740
Not now.

829
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,240
What grace is given me...

830
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,740
...let it pass to him.

831
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,140
Let him be spared.

832
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,740
Save him.

833
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:09,940
Hear my voice... come back to the light.

834
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,240
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

835
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:28,040
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

836
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,940
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

837
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,740
And you're lucky to be here too.

838
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,340
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

839
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:47,630
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

840
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,830
What happened, Gandalf?

841
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:04,130
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

842
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:10,630
I was delayed.

843
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:15,730
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

844
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:24,530
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

845
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,630
Embrace the power of the ring...

846
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,730
...or embrace your own destruction!

847
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:36,830
There is only one lord of the ring.

848
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,130
Only one who can bend it to his will.

849
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:45,930
And he does not share power.

850
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:03,530
So you have chosen... death.

851
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:17,430
Gandalf? What is it?

852
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:20,330
Nothing, Frodo.

853
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:22,930
Frodo!

854
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,530
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

855
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,530
Sam has hardly left your side.

856
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,130
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

857
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:37,430
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

858
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:42,530
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

859
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,820
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

860
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:35,920
Bilbo.

861
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,819
There and back again

862
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:45,520
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

863
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,120
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

864
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,220
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

865
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,020
...visit Lake-town...

866
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,620
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

867
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,920
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

868
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,020
I miss the Shire.

869
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,420
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

870
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,320
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

871
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,820
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

872
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,320
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

873
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,820
My dear boy.

874
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,820
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

875
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,420
No harm in being prepared.

876
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,220
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

877
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,220
- More than anything.
- I did.

878
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,520
It's just...

879
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,820
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

880
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,620
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

881
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,220
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

882
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,120
Off home.

883
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,220
You are right, Sam.

884
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,220
We did what we set out to do.

885
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,320
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

886
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,820
I am ready to go home.

887
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,520
His strength returns.

888
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:50,320
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

889
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,620
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

890
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,420
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

891
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:01,110
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

892
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:06,620
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

893
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:11,440
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

894
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,440
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

895
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,940
Our list of allies grows thin.

896
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,440
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

897
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:25,240
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

898
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,940
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

899
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,740
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

900
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,450
Saruman is coming for the ring.

901
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:39,850
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

902
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:44,450
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

903
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:49,460
Gandalf...

904
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,260
...the ring cannot stay here.

905
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:16,070
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

906
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:19,070
They must decide now how to end it.

907
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:23,580
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

908
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,880
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

909
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:33,180
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

910
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,680
It is in men that we must place our hope.

911
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,790
Men?

912
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:43,790
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

913
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:48,390
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

914
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:52,290
It is because of men the ring survives.

915
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:54,190
I was there, Gandalf.

916
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,700
I was there 3000 years ago...

917
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,900
...when Isildur took the ring.

918
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:10,900
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

919
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:16,110
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

920
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:21,310
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

921
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:25,110
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

922
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:27,810
Cast it into the fire!

923
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,720
- Destroy it!
- No.

924
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,320
Isildur!

925
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:45,420
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

926
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,820
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

927
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:58,430
There's no strength left in the world of men.

928
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:03,430
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

929
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:07,030
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

930
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:12,540
He turned from that path a long time ago.

931
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,940
He has chosen exile.

932
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,960
You are no elf.

933
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,260
Men of the South are welcome here.

934
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,360
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

935
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,660
Then we are here on common purpose...

936
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,460
...friend.

937
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:18,670
The shards of Narsil.

938
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:26,480
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

939
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,780
It's still sharp.

940
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:43,690
But no more than a broken heirloom.

941
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,700
Why do you fear the past?

942
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:19,710
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.

943
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:23,510
You are not bound to his fate.

944
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:27,910
The same blood flows in my veins.

945
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,620
The same weakness.

946
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:39,090
Your time will come.

947
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:43,590
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

948
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,580
The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn

949
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,880
Not over you, not over me.

950
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,970
Do you remember when we first met?

951
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:15,770
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

952
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:19,370
Long years have passed.

953
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:24,060
You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

954
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,360
Do you remember what I told you?

955
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:36,860
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

956
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:43,760
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

957
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,950
And to that I hold.

958
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:50,650
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

959
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:54,750
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

960
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:06,940
I choose a mortal life.

961
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,540
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

962
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,340
...like my heart.

963
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:37,830
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

964
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:41,930
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

965
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:47,430
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

966
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:51,220
You will unite, or you will fall.

967
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:55,720
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

968
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,020
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

969
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:16,910
So it is true.

970
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,200
<i>The ring of power...</i>

971
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,800
<i>The doom of men...</i>

972
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,400
In a dream...

973
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:41,300
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

974
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:43,290
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

975
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,890
A voice was crying:

976
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,990
"Your doom is near at hand.

977
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:52,790
Isildur's bane is found."

978
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,590
Isildur's bane.

979
01:38:59,180 --> 01:38:59,480
Boromir!

980
01:38:59,481 --> 01:39:02,880
"One ring to rule them all...

981
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:06,680
...One ring to find them...

982
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:10,280
...One ring to bring them all...

983
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:17,580
...and in the darkness bind them."

984
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:27,370
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

985
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:31,270
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

986
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:33,570
...for the black speech of Mordor...

987
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:35,270
...may yet be heard...

988
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:38,370
...in every corner of the West!

989
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:41,270
The ring is altogether evil.

990
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:43,170
It is a gift.

991
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,860
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

992
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,560
Why not use this ring?

993
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:51,560
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

994
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:55,960
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

995
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,560
...are your lands kept safe.

996
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,560
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

997
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:08,550
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

998
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:13,250
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

999
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:17,050
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1000
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:19,250
This is no mere ranger.

1001
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:23,840
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1002
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,340
You owe him your allegiance.

1003
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:33,440
Aragorn.

1004
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,040
This is Isildur's heir?

1005
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:43,140
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1006
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,930
Sit down, Legolas.

1007
01:40:50,030 --> 01:40:52,830
Gondor has no king.

1008
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:56,430
Gondor needs no king.

1009
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,620
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1010
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:11,120
You have only one choice.

1011
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,720
The ring must be destroyed.

1012
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,520
Then what are we waiting for?

1013
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:36,870
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1014
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:41,370
...by any craft that we here possess.

1015
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:45,970
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1016
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:50,060
Only there can it be unmade.

1017
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,760
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1018
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:58,360
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1019
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,860
<i>One ring to rule them all...</i>

1020
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,950
One of you...

1021
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,650
...must do this.

1022
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:12,250
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1023
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,750
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1024
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:21,640
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1025
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:26,140
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1026
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:28,930
It is a barren wasteland...

1027
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:32,630
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1028
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:36,830
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1029
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:41,230
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1030
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:45,930
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1031
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,720
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1032
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:53,520
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1033
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,020
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1034
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:03,610
Never trust an elf!

1035
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:10,510
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1036
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:13,810
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1037
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:17,200
<i>One ring to rule them all...</i>

1038
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,700
<i>...One ring to find them...</i>

1039
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,800
<i>One ring to rule them all...</i>

1040
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,800
<i>...One ring to find them...</i>

1041
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,800
<i>One ring to rule them all...</i>

1042
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,990
<i>...One ring to find them...</i>

1043
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:30,090
<i>One ring to rule them all...</i>

1044
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,590
I will take it.

1045
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:39,390
I will take it.

1046
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:48,180
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1047
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:57,570
Though...

1048
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:02,570
...I do not know the way.

1049
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:08,670
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1050
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,360
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1051
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:16,560
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1052
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,660
...I will.

1053
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,160
You have my sword.

1054
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:28,050
And you have my bow.

1055
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:31,050
And my ax.

1056
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,040
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1057
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:46,740
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1058
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,840
...then Gondor will see it done.

1059
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,040
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1060
01:44:57,430 --> 01:45:02,130
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1061
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,630
Oy. We're coming too!

1062
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:09,520
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1063
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,920
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1064
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:14,620
...mission.

1065
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:16,420
Quest.

1066
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,920
Thing.

1067
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,420
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1068
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:25,910
Nine companions.

1069
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,510
So be it.

1070
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,910
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1071
01:45:33,610 --> 01:45:35,410
Great!

1072
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,910
Where are we going?

1073
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,400
She wanted to protect her child.

1074
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:21,090
She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1075
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:27,490
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1076
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,800
That you'd never escape your fate.

1077
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,700
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

1078
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:38,100
...but only you have the power to wield it.

1079
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,700
I do not want that power.

1080
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,600
I have never wanted it.

1081
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,400
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1082
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,300
My old sword! Sting.

1083
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,800
Here, take it. Take it.

1084
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:06,000
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

1085
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,800
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

1086
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:15,700
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1087
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,400
Here's a pretty thing.

1088
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,100
Mithril.

1089
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,200
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1090
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,700
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1091
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,900
My old ring.

1092
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,000
I should very much like...

1093
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:48,200
...to hold it again, one last time.

1094
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:09,210
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1095
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:13,610
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1096
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,310
I'm sorry for everything.

1097
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:40,510
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

1098
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:44,410
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1099
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,810
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1100
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:53,710
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1101
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:58,010
May the blessings of elves and men...

1102
01:48:58,810 --> 01:49:01,310
...and all free folk go with you.

1103
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:08,310
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1104
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:29,410
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1105
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:31,810
Left.

1106
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,620
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1107
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:59,620
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1108
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:03,620
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1109
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:07,520
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1110
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,520
Move your feet.

1111
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,040
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1112
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,720
Faster!

1113
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:18,720
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1114
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:21,620
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1115
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,220
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1116
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,620
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1117
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:35,220
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1118
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:45,830
Sorry!

1119
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,020
Get him!

1120
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:51,830
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1121
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,730
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1122
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:00,130
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1123
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:03,230
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1124
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:06,130
It's moving fast.

1125
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:08,630
Against the wind.

1126
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,530
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1127
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:14,430
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1128
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,630
Spies of Saruman.

1129
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,530
The passage south is being watched.

1130
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:58,130
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1131
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:12,330
Frodo!

1132
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:33,630
Boromir.

1133
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:38,130
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1134
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:41,340
...over so small a thing.

1135
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,640
Such a little thing.

1136
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:48,340
Boromir!

1137
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,540
Give the ring to Frodo.

1138
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:03,440
As you wish.

1139
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:06,240
I care not.

1140
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:46,140
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1141
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:51,040
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1142
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:55,340
If the mountain defeats you...

1143
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:59,940
...will you risk a more dangerous road?

1144
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:12,240
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

1145
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:15,240
There is a fell voice on the air.

1146
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:16,516
May your horn be bloodstained!

1147
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:17,940
It's Saruman!

1148
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:31,350
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1149
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:33,550
No!

1150
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:41,650
Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!

1151
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:46,950
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

1152
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:51,450
May your bloodstained horn...

1153
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:55,150
...fall upon enemy heads!

1154
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:41,850
We must get off the mountain!

1155
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:46,550
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1156
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:50,150
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1157
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:54,050
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1158
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:57,150
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1159
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:02,650
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1160
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:08,350
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1161
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:14,150
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1162
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:18,850
Shadow and flame.

1163
01:57:22,450 --> 01:57:25,050
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1164
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:31,960
We cannot stay here!

1165
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,860
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1166
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:36,760
Frodo?

1167
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:42,560
We will go through the mines.

1168
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,360
So be it.

1169
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:55,760
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1170
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,560
How is your shoulder?

1171
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:04,960
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1172
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:09,160
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1173
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:12,460
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1174
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:16,760
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1175
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:19,560
And, I fear, from within.

1176
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:26,360
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1177
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:29,360
Trust your own strengths.

1178
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,260
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1179
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,460
...for good or for evil.

1180
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,960
Some are greater than I am.

1181
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,960
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1182
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,860
The walls...

1183
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,660
...of Moria.

1184
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,360
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1185
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:59,860
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1186
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,860
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1187
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:14,060
Well, let's see.

1188
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:15,860
Ithildin.

1189
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:19,770
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1190
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:38,370
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1191
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:43,370
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1192
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:48,070
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

1193
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:53,870
Gate of the elves, open now for me!

1194
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:08,470
...listen to the word of my tongue.

1195
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:12,970
Nothing's happening.

1196
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:24,170
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

1197
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:27,370
...men and orcs.

1198
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:28,910
What are you going to do, then?

1199
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:31,270
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1200
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:33,470
And if that does not shatter them...

1201
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:36,370
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1202
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:39,970
...I will try to find the opening words.

1203
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:45,570
Gate of elves...

1204
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:49,770
...listen to my word...

1205
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:52,470
...threshold of dwarves...

1206
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:55,370
Mines are no place for a pony.

1207
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:59,570
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1208
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:00,970
Doorway of the dwarf-folk...

1209
02:01:01,070 --> 02:01:03,670
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1210
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:07,880
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1211
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:17,180
Do not disturb the water.

1212
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,380
Oh, it's useless.

1213
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,180
It's a riddle.

1214
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:40,080
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1215
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:43,380
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1216
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,080
Mellon.

1217
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:08,880
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1218
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:14,980
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1219
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:19,680
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1220
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,580
And they call it a mine.

1221
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:24,680
A mine!

1222
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:28,980
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1223
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:36,780
No...

1224
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:39,690
No!

1225
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,880
Goblins.

1226
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,980
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1227
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:55,680
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1228
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:00,880
- Frodo!
- Help!

1229
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:02,790
Strider!

1230
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:05,590
- Help!
- Get off him!

1231
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:06,890
Aragorn!

1232
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:18,390
Frodo!

1233
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:45,790
Into the mines!

1234
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:49,090
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1235
02:03:53,490 --> 02:03:55,190
Run!

1236
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:15,690
We now have but one choice.

1237
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:20,590
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1238
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:22,990
Be on your guard.

1239
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:26,590
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

1240
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:30,290
...in the deep places of the world.

1241
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:42,090
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1242
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:46,200
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1243
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,700
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1244
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,400
...or jewels...

1245
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,600
...but mithril.

1246
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:04,700
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1247
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:09,000
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1248
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:11,100
I never told him...

1249
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:16,100
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

1250
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:30,300
Pippin.

1251
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:53,510
I have no memory of this place.

1252
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:57,110
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1253
02:06:57,410 --> 02:06:59,810
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1254
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:01,510
- Merry?
- What?

1255
02:07:01,810 --> 02:07:03,610
I'm hungry.

1256
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:19,310
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1257
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:23,610
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1258
02:07:24,110 --> 02:07:28,110
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1259
02:07:28,910 --> 02:07:30,510
...or was set loose.

1260
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:34,610
Now the ring has brought him here.

1261
02:07:37,310 --> 02:07:40,010
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1262
02:07:40,410 --> 02:07:45,810
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1263
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:50,910
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1264
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:57,010
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1265
02:07:58,210 --> 02:08:00,910
Before it drove him mad.

1266
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:04,010
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1267
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:05,410
Pity?

1268
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:09,410
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1269
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:15,410
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1270
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:19,510
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1271
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:25,810
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1272
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,920
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1273
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:35,310
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1274
02:08:36,410 --> 02:08:39,110
...before this is over.

1275
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:44,410
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1276
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:54,520
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1277
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:58,020
I wish none of this had happened.

1278
02:08:58,210 --> 02:09:03,010
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1279
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:09,420
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1280
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:14,920
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1281
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,920
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1282
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:22,620
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1283
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:26,020
And that is an encouraging thought.

1284
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:32,920
It's that way.

1285
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:35,420
- He's remembered.
- No.

1286
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:39,320
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1287
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:44,620
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1288
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:03,720
Let me risk a little more light.

1289
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:10,530
Behold...

1290
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:16,120
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1291
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,020
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1292
02:10:47,130 --> 02:10:48,830
Gimli!

1293
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:57,830
No!

1294
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:03,530
Oh, no.

1295
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:06,630
No.

1296
02:11:14,030 --> 02:11:15,930
"Here lies Balin...

1297
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:18,430
...son of Fundin...

1298
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:21,330
...Lord of Moria."

1299
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:24,030
He is dead, then.

1300
02:11:25,930 --> 02:11:27,530
It's as I feared.

1301
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:48,630
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1302
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:53,430
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1303
02:11:54,730 --> 02:11:57,230
We have barred the gates...

1304
02:11:57,930 --> 02:12:00,330
...but cannot hold them for long.

1305
02:12:00,630 --> 02:12:03,330
The ground shakes.

1306
02:12:03,930 --> 02:12:05,330
Drums...

1307
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:09,030
...drums in the deep.

1308
02:12:12,830 --> 02:12:14,730
We cannot get out.

1309
02:12:16,830 --> 02:12:20,530
A shadow moves in the dark.

1310
02:12:22,330 --> 02:12:24,830
We cannot get out.

1311
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,740
They are coming."

1312
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:14,740
Fool of a Took!

1313
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:18,740
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1314
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:46,540
Frodo!

1315
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,340
Orcs.

1316
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:59,340
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1317
02:14:06,650 --> 02:14:08,350
They have a cave-troll.

1318
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:25,340
Let them come!

1319
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:29,150
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1320
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:50,960
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1321
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,460
Frodo!

1322
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:32,760
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1323
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:35,660
Frodo!

1324
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:22,770
Frodo!

1325
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:24,370
Oh, no.

1326
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,570
He's alive.

1327
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:39,970
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1328
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:42,370
You should be dead.

1329
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:45,070
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1330
02:19:45,370 --> 02:19:49,970
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1331
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:57,080
Mithril.

1332
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:02,380
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1333
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:10,180
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1334
02:20:25,380 --> 02:20:26,980
This way!

1335
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:40,280
What is this new devilry?

1336
02:21:56,490 --> 02:21:59,290
A Balrog.

1337
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:02,690
A demon of the ancient world.

1338
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:07,290
This foe is beyond any of you.

1339
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:10,090
Run!

1340
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:18,890
Quickly!

1341
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:36,890
Gandalf.

1342
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:38,990
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1343
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:42,990
The bridge is near.

1344
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:48,990
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1345
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:19,890
Gandalf!

1346
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:39,500
Merry! Pippin!

1347
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:52,100
Sam!

1348
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:58,000
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1349
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,600
Not the beard!

1350
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:17,800
Steady.

1351
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,400
Hold on!

1352
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:43,800
Hang on!

1353
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,200
Lean forward!

1354
02:24:59,300 --> 02:25:00,300
Steady.

1355
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:02,700
Come on!

1356
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,400
Now!

1357
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,300
Over the bridge!

1358
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,100
Fly!

1359
02:26:09,810 --> 02:26:11,810
You cannot pass!

1360
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:13,710
Gandalf!

1361
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:22,710
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1362
02:26:23,810 --> 02:26:27,510
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

1363
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:39,610
Go back to the Shadow.

1364
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:51,710
You - shall not - pass!

1365
02:27:19,010 --> 02:27:22,710
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1366
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:32,920
Fly, you fools!

1367
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,220
No!

1368
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:47,520
Aragorn!

1369
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:47,720
Legolas, get them up.

1370
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:53,620
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1371
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:57,420
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1372
02:28:57,820 --> 02:29:00,920
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1373
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:05,220
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1374
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:09,020
On your feet, Sam.

1375
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:10,820
Frodo?

1376
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:14,520
Frodo!

1377
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:09,530
Stay close, young hobbits!

1378
02:30:10,430 --> 02:30:14,430
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1379
02:30:14,730 --> 02:30:17,130
An elf-witch...

1380
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:20,630
...of terrible power.

1381
02:30:21,330 --> 02:30:23,430
All who look upon her...

1382
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:25,430
...fall under her spell.

1383
02:30:25,730 --> 02:30:26,930
<i>Frodo!</i>

1384
02:30:29,230 --> 02:30:31,230
And are never seen again.

1385
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:35,730
<i>Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1386
02:30:36,130 --> 02:30:39,730
<i>You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.</i>

1387
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:41,730
Mr. Frodo?

1388
02:30:47,230 --> 02:30:52,630
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1389
02:30:52,930 --> 02:30:57,330
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1390
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:09,540
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1391
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:17,040
Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.

1392
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:19,340
Our fellowship stands in your debt,

1393
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:21,240
Haldir of Lórien.

1394
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:25,040
Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain...

1395
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:27,530
...you are known to us.

1396
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:28,330
Haldir.

1397
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:30,316
So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

1398
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:32,240
Speak words we can all understand!

1399
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:36,840
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

1400
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,640
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

1401
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:44,640
I spit upon your grave!

1402
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,540
That was not so courteous.

1403
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:59,040
You bring great evil with you.

1404
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,140
You can go no further.

1405
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:12,240
We need your protection. The road is fell!

1406
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:16,440
I wish we may come with you.

1407
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:18,640
Please, understand, we need your support!

1408
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:22,840
Aragorn!

1409
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:35,340
I wish we may come with you.

1410
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:39,540
The road is very dangerous.

1411
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:43,040
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1412
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,140
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1413
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:50,940
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1414
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,040
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1415
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:59,940
You will follow me.

1416
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:13,650
Cares Galeton.

1417
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:17,150
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1418
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:22,850
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1419
02:34:42,250 --> 02:34:45,150
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1420
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:50,860
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1421
02:34:52,850 --> 02:34:57,050
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1422
02:34:57,560 --> 02:34:59,360
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1423
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:02,560
For I much desire to speak with him.

1424
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:05,460
I can no longer see him from afar.

1425
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:11,460
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1426
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,260
He has fallen into shadow.

1427
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:23,360
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1428
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:28,760
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1429
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:32,960
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1430
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:38,260
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1431
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:42,260
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1432
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:51,160
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1433
02:35:51,560 --> 02:35:53,760
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1434
02:35:54,860 --> 02:35:58,260
For the world has grown full of peril...

1435
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:02,460
...and in all lands...

1436
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,160
...love is now mingled with grief.

1437
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:21,560
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1438
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:25,060
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1439
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:31,360
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1440
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:34,460
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1441
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:38,160
...to the ruin of all.

1442
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:48,160
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

1443
02:36:49,970 --> 02:36:54,470
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1444
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:58,670
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1445
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:03,070
Tonight, you will sleep...

1446
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:06,770
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1447
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:10,070
<i>...one who has seen the eye!</i>

1448
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:27,270
A lament for Gandalf.

1449
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:36,070
What do they say about him?

1450
02:37:36,570 --> 02:37:38,970
I have not the heart to tell you.

1451
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:44,170
For me, the grief is still too near.

1452
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:49,970
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1453
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:53,170
There should be a verse about them.

1454
02:37:56,670 --> 02:37:58,570
The finest rockets ever seen

1455
02:37:59,770 --> 02:38:02,570
They burst in stars of blue and green

1456
02:38:03,670 --> 02:38:08,670
Or after thunder, silver showers

1457
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:12,170
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1458
02:38:12,570 --> 02:38:16,270
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1459
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:29,780
Take some rest.

1460
02:38:30,070 --> 02:38:32,670
These borders are well-protected.

1461
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:35,370
I will find no rest here.

1462
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:41,170
I heard her voice inside my head.

1463
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:45,170
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1464
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:50,680
She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

1465
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:54,970
But I cannot see it.

1466
02:38:56,470 --> 02:38:58,870
It is long since we had any hope.

1467
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:11,280
My father is a noble man.

1468
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:14,280
But his rule is failing...

1469
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:19,880
...and our people lose faith.

1470
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:24,880
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1471
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:28,580
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1472
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:34,480
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1473
02:39:35,180 --> 02:39:37,080
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1474
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:41,080
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1475
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:45,280
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1476
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:50,280
Have you ever been called home...

1477
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,280
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1478
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:58,080
I have seen the white city...

1479
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,980
...long ago.

1480
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:05,880
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1481
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:09,780
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1482
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:13,580
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1483
02:41:20,990 --> 02:41:23,390
Will you look into the mirror?

1484
02:41:23,690 --> 02:41:25,090
What will I see?

1485
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:30,490
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1486
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:33,190
For the mirror...

1487
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:35,890
...shows many things.

1488
02:41:38,990 --> 02:41:41,190
Things that were...

1489
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:44,090
...things that are...

1490
02:41:44,890 --> 02:41:46,690
...and some things...

1491
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:53,690
...that have not yet come to pass.

1492
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:19,100
I know what it is you saw.

1493
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:23,900
For it is also in my mind.

1494
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:29,700
<i>It is what will come to pass if you should fail.</i>

1495
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:36,900
<i>The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1496
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:41,000
<i>He will try to take the ring.</i>

1497
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:43,200
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1498
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:48,700
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1499
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:52,800
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1500
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:56,200
<i>...I will give you the one ring.</i>

1501
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:59,600
<i>You offer it to me freely.</i>

1502
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:07,900
<i>I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.</i>

1503
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:17,700
In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

1504
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:21,800
...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

1505
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:25,600
Treacherous as the sea!

1506
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:30,910
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1507
02:44:31,610 --> 02:44:33,910
All shall love me...

1508
02:44:34,210 --> 02:44:36,910
...and despair.

1509
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:55,310
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1510
02:44:55,710 --> 02:44:58,010
...and go into the West...

1511
02:44:58,410 --> 02:45:02,710
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1512
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:10,410
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1513
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:12,910
...is to be alone.

1514
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:19,110
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1515
02:45:19,410 --> 02:45:20,910
And I am its keeper.

1516
02:45:24,210 --> 02:45:27,710
This task was appointed to you.

1517
02:45:28,910 --> 02:45:31,610
And if you do not find a way...

1518
02:45:33,010 --> 02:45:34,910
...no one will.

1519
02:45:35,410 --> 02:45:38,410
Then I know what I must do.

1520
02:45:39,110 --> 02:45:40,310
It's just...

1521
02:45:43,610 --> 02:45:45,810
...I'm afraid to do it.

1522
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:54,310
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1523
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:05,410
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

1524
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:09,520
They were elves once.

1525
02:46:10,810 --> 02:46:14,010
Taken by the dark powers...

1526
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:17,510
...tortured and mutilated.

1527
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:23,010
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1528
02:46:23,420 --> 02:46:25,220
And now...

1529
02:46:26,820 --> 02:46:28,620
...perfected.

1530
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:32,420
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1531
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:36,720
...whom do you serve?

1532
02:46:37,020 --> 02:46:39,420
Saruman!

1533
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:03,620
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

1534
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:06,820
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1535
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,920
You will taste man-flesh!

1536
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:18,620
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1537
02:47:19,020 --> 02:47:23,020
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1538
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:26,320
Kill the others.

1539
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:50,720
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1540
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:55,720
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

1541
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:04,630
Lembas.

1542
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:06,530
Elvish waybread.

1543
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:11,830
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1544
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:20,320
How many did you eat?

1545
02:48:20,530 --> 02:48:22,130
Four.

1546
02:48:28,030 --> 02:48:30,530
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1547
02:48:30,830 --> 02:48:34,730
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

1548
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:37,530
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1549
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:41,530
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

1550
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:46,730
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1551
02:48:55,330 --> 02:48:57,530
You are being tracked.

1552
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:04,030
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

1553
02:49:21,530 --> 02:49:26,130
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

1554
02:49:26,530 --> 02:49:29,830
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

1555
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:37,830
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

1556
02:49:38,130 --> 02:49:41,930
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

1557
02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:44,430
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

1558
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:47,830
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1559
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:51,840
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1560
02:49:52,030 --> 02:49:54,730
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

1561
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:56,930
Thank you, my lady.

1562
02:49:58,830 --> 02:50:02,030
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1563
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:11,440
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

1564
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:13,930
Nothing.

1565
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:17,840
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1566
02:50:18,540 --> 02:50:23,540
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1567
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:32,240
Actually...

1568
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:34,140
There was one thing.

1569
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,540
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

1570
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:40,540
Stupid to ask.

1571
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:45,240
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1572
02:50:45,440 --> 02:50:48,940
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

1573
02:50:49,940 --> 02:50:51,740
For her love...

1574
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:57,340
...I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

1575
02:50:58,640 --> 02:51:03,140
I would have her leave these shores...

1576
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:06,740
...and be with her people.

1577
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:14,040
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1578
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:17,340
That choice is yet before her.

1579
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:21,040
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1580
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:26,940
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1581
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:31,640
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1582
02:51:39,140 --> 02:51:41,040
Farewell.

1583
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:48,340
There is much you have yet to do.

1584
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:58,040
We shall not meet again, Elessar.

1585
02:51:59,450 --> 02:52:02,550
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1586
02:52:02,750 --> 02:52:06,050
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

1587
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:09,250
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

1588
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:22,650
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

1589
02:52:23,050 --> 02:52:27,050
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1590
02:52:36,150 --> 02:52:39,150
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1591
02:52:39,950 --> 02:52:43,950
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1592
02:52:44,950 --> 02:52:48,150
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1593
02:52:48,550 --> 02:52:50,450
What was her gift?

1594
02:52:50,750 --> 02:52:55,450
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1595
02:52:56,350 --> 02:52:59,150
She gave me three.

1596
02:54:41,460 --> 02:54:44,760
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1597
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:51,560
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1598
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:54,960
But he's too clever a waterman.

1599
02:54:55,960 --> 02:54:59,160
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1600
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:01,460
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1601
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:03,760
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1602
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:07,060
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1603
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:10,360
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1604
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:14,260
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1605
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:15,660
But you're not.

1606
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:18,560
I'm here to help you.

1607
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:20,360
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1608
02:55:26,470 --> 02:55:28,970
You can't help me, Sam.

1609
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:32,970
Not this time.

1610
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:37,960
Get some sleep.

1611
02:55:44,370 --> 02:55:46,470
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1612
02:55:47,070 --> 02:55:49,670
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1613
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:52,570
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1614
02:55:52,970 --> 02:55:55,670
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1615
02:55:56,370 --> 02:55:58,270
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1616
02:56:00,170 --> 02:56:02,970
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1617
02:56:03,170 --> 02:56:05,970
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1618
02:56:06,370 --> 02:56:09,570
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1619
02:56:09,870 --> 02:56:11,970
But you will not see that.

1620
02:56:12,470 --> 02:56:13,770
You are afraid!

1621
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:16,570
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1622
02:56:16,970 --> 02:56:20,270
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1623
02:56:22,870 --> 02:56:27,070
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1624
02:56:39,070 --> 02:56:40,370
Frodo.

1625
02:56:42,270 --> 02:56:43,670
The Argonath.

1626
02:56:47,270 --> 02:56:50,770
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1627
02:56:51,670 --> 02:56:53,470
My kin.

1628
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:14,680
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1629
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:17,480
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1630
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:21,080
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1631
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:25,380
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1632
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:28,780
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1633
02:58:29,080 --> 02:58:32,080
And after that, it gets even better.

1634
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:37,280
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1635
02:58:37,780 --> 02:58:39,080
That is our road.

1636
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:43,780
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1637
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:45,680
Recover my...

1638
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:50,680
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1639
02:58:50,980 --> 02:58:55,180
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1640
02:58:55,580 --> 02:58:58,980
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1641
02:58:59,280 --> 02:59:03,080
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1642
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:07,780
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1643
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:14,680
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1644
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:17,080
Where's Frodo?

1645
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:44,690
None of us should wander alone.

1646
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:48,090
You, least of all.

1647
02:59:48,390 --> 02:59:50,690
So much depends on you.

1648
02:59:51,890 --> 02:59:53,790
Frodo?

1649
03:00:00,990 --> 03:00:03,490
I know why you seek solitude.

1650
03:00:04,290 --> 03:00:07,590
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1651
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:11,490
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1652
03:00:13,190 --> 03:00:15,790
There are other ways, Frodo.

1653
03:00:16,090 --> 03:00:19,790
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1654
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:23,690
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1655
03:00:24,090 --> 03:00:27,090
Warning... against what?

1656
03:00:27,390 --> 03:00:29,390
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1657
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:33,190
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1658
03:00:33,590 --> 03:00:37,190
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1659
03:00:39,190 --> 03:00:42,290
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1660
03:00:44,090 --> 03:00:45,990
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1661
03:00:47,290 --> 03:00:50,790
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1662
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:55,990
What chance do you think you have?

1663
03:00:56,300 --> 03:01:00,800
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1664
03:01:01,190 --> 03:01:04,790
And you will beg for death before the end!

1665
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,100
You fool!

1666
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:13,190
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1667
03:01:13,490 --> 03:01:16,190
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1668
03:01:16,490 --> 03:01:17,690
- Give it to me!
- No!

1669
03:01:17,990 --> 03:01:19,790
- Give it to me!
- No.

1670
03:01:27,500 --> 03:01:29,400
I see your mind.

1671
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:32,600
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1672
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:34,700
You will betray us!

1673
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,100
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1674
03:01:38,600 --> 03:01:42,100
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1675
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:50,800
Frodo?

1676
03:01:55,100 --> 03:01:56,700
Frodo.

1677
03:02:00,700 --> 03:02:02,600
What have I done?

1678
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:04,600
Please, Frodo.

1679
03:02:04,900 --> 03:02:07,400
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1680
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:41,300
They will fall

1681
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:57,400
Frodo?

1682
03:02:58,700 --> 03:03:01,700
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1683
03:03:02,110 --> 03:03:03,810
Stay away!

1684
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:05,800
Frodo!

1685
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:11,800
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1686
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:24,010
Would you destroy it?

1687
03:03:29,210 --> 03:03:31,010
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1688
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:36,710
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1689
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:40,410
<i>Elessar.</i>

1690
03:03:48,110 --> 03:03:51,310
I would have gone with you to the end.

1691
03:03:52,110 --> 03:03:54,910
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1692
03:03:58,410 --> 03:03:59,510
I know.

1693
03:04:01,910 --> 03:04:07,210
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1694
03:04:11,210 --> 03:04:12,810
Go, Frodo!

1695
03:04:15,910 --> 03:04:17,410
Run.

1696
03:04:17,610 --> 03:04:19,210
Run!

1697
03:04:43,810 --> 03:04:45,410
Mr. Frodo!

1698
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:56,510
Find the halfling!

1699
03:04:58,210 --> 03:05:00,610
Find the halfling!

1700
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:05,910
Elendil!

1701
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:13,920
Aragorn, go!

1702
03:05:35,620 --> 03:05:36,920
Frodo!

1703
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:39,120
Hide here. Quick!

1704
03:05:39,820 --> 03:05:41,220
Come on!

1705
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:45,720
What's he doing?

1706
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:51,920
He's leaving.

1707
03:05:56,820 --> 03:05:59,620
- No!
- Pippin!

1708
03:06:04,620 --> 03:06:06,820
Run, Frodo. Go!

1709
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:10,420
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1710
03:06:11,020 --> 03:06:12,520
- Over here!
- This way!

1711
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:25,720
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1712
03:07:21,130 --> 03:07:24,030
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1713
03:08:07,330 --> 03:08:08,330
Run!

1714
03:11:40,050 --> 03:11:41,550
No.

1715
03:11:45,650 --> 03:11:48,550
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1716
03:11:48,850 --> 03:11:50,850
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1717
03:11:52,850 --> 03:11:54,250
I let Frodo go.

1718
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:57,450
Then you did what I could not.

1719
03:11:58,550 --> 03:12:01,750
I tried to take the ring from him.

1720
03:12:02,350 --> 03:12:06,450
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1721
03:12:06,850 --> 03:12:09,050
I did not see it.

1722
03:12:09,350 --> 03:12:12,450
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1723
03:12:13,050 --> 03:12:15,450
You fought bravely.

1724
03:12:15,850 --> 03:12:18,350
You have kept your honor.

1725
03:12:19,150 --> 03:12:20,850
Leave it.

1726
03:12:21,350 --> 03:12:23,350
It is over.

1727
03:12:24,660 --> 03:12:29,760
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

1728
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:33,150
...and my city to ruin.

1729
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:40,060
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1730
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:44,160
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1731
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:47,660
...nor our people fail.

1732
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:50,060
Our people.

1733
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,960
Our people.

1734
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:20,660
I would have followed you, my brother.

1735
03:13:22,360 --> 03:13:24,260
My captain.

1736
03:13:27,060 --> 03:13:28,860
My king.

1737
03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:50,660
Be at peace...

1738
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:53,060
...son of Gondor.

1739
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:12,760
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

1740
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:16,360
But he will not return.

1741
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:41,670
Frodo!

1742
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:04,370
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

1743
03:15:05,670 --> 03:15:08,470
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1744
03:15:11,670 --> 03:15:14,370
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

1745
03:15:14,670 --> 03:15:17,970
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1746
03:15:18,370 --> 03:15:20,870
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1747
03:15:21,170 --> 03:15:25,770
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

1748
03:15:54,670 --> 03:15:56,670
Frodo, no!

1749
03:15:57,470 --> 03:15:58,670
Frodo!

1750
03:15:59,380 --> 03:16:01,980
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1751
03:16:05,670 --> 03:16:07,570
Go back, Sam!

1752
03:16:08,170 --> 03:16:11,570
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1753
03:16:11,870 --> 03:16:14,570
And I'm coming with you!

1754
03:16:15,270 --> 03:16:17,570
You can't swim!

1755
03:16:21,370 --> 03:16:23,070
Sam!

1756
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:30,080
Sam!

1757
03:17:10,980 --> 03:17:13,680
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1758
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:18,180
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1759
03:17:19,480 --> 03:17:21,980
And I don't mean to.

1760
03:17:22,380 --> 03:17:24,480
I don't mean to.

1761
03:17:26,280 --> 03:17:27,980
Oh Sam.

1762
03:17:42,980 --> 03:17:44,580
Come on.

1763
03:18:12,980 --> 03:18:17,380
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1764
03:18:32,490 --> 03:18:37,390
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1765
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:45,590
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1766
03:18:57,590 --> 03:19:00,690
Not if we hold true to each other.

1767
03:19:02,190 --> 03:19:06,490
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1768
03:19:07,590 --> 03:19:12,690
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1769
03:19:14,190 --> 03:19:16,090
We travel light.

1770
03:19:16,390 --> 03:19:18,290
Let us hunt some orc.

1771
03:19:21,290 --> 03:19:23,290
Yes!

1772
03:19:42,290 --> 03:19:43,690
Mordor.

1773
03:19:44,390 --> 03:19:47,590
I hope the others find a safer road.

1774
03:19:48,690 --> 03:19:51,190
Strider will look after them.

1775
03:19:52,300 --> 03:19:55,500
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1776
03:19:55,990 --> 03:19:58,290
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1777
03:19:58,500 --> 03:20:00,000
We may.

1778
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:03,300
Sam...

1779
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:09,400
...I'm glad you are with me.
