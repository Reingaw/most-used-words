982
01:44:57,415 --> 01:44:58,875
What?

983
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:03,004
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

984
01:45:03,087 --> 01:45:06,424
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

985
01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:09,552
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

986
01:45:09,636 --> 01:45:11,387
"Yes, my boy.

987
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:15,350
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

988
01:45:15,433 --> 01:45:18,061
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

989
01:45:18,144 --> 01:45:20,104
"Samwise the Brave."

990
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:22,982
I want to hear more about Sam.

991
01:45:27,278 --> 01:45:30,281
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

992
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:35,662
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

993
01:45:36,746 --> 01:45:38,122
So was I.

994
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:49,717
"Samwise the Brave."

995
01:45:53,972 --> 01:45:55,348
FRODO:
Sméagol?

996
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:58,434
SAM: We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

997
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:00,520
Master.

998
01:46:00,603 --> 01:46:03,606
Master looks after us.

999
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:07,235
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1000
01:46:07,318 --> 01:46:09,863
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.

1001
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:12,198
SMEAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.

1002
01:46:12,282 --> 01:46:15,577
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1003
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:18,580
Master betrayed us.

1004
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,833
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1005
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:25,920
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1006
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:28,840
Kill him! Kill him!

1007
01:46:28,923 --> 01:46:30,508
Kill them both!

1008
01:46:30,592 --> 01:46:34,304
And then we take the precious...

1009
01:46:34,387 --> 01:46:37,974
...and we be the master!

1010
01:46:38,641 --> 01:46:41,352
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1011
01:46:41,436 --> 01:46:44,063
Eyes always watching.

1012
01:46:44,314 --> 01:46:47,901
Then we stabs them out.

1013
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:52,572
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1014
01:46:52,655 --> 01:46:56,200
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1015
01:46:56,284 --> 01:46:59,078
Kill them both.

1016
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:01,748
Yes. No! No!

1017
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:05,585
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1018
01:47:06,294 --> 01:47:08,922
SAM:
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1019
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,716
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
FRODO: Sméagol?

1020
01:47:11,799 --> 01:47:17,221
We could let her do it.

1021
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:22,393
Yes. She could do it.

1022
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:27,106
Yes, precious, she could.

1023
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:33,279
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1024
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:35,990
Once they're dead.

1025
01:47:36,074 --> 01:47:38,117
Shh.

1026
01:47:41,454 --> 01:47:45,208
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1027
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:47,418
Sméagol will show you the way.

1028
01:47:47,502 --> 01:47:49,796
Follow me.

1029
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:11,150
