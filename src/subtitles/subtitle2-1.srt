01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,524
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

660
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,110
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

661
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,989
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

662
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:45,242
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

663
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:50,080
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

664
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,083
But for all their cunning...

665
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,794
...we have one advantage.

666
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,507
The Ring remains hidden.

667
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,552
And that we should seek to destroy it...

668

...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

669
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,601
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

670
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:12,269
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

672

We must trust now in Frodo.
